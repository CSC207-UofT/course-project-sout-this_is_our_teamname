# Progress Report

## Purpose Of The Project

As university students, every member of our group needs to have frequent access to 
a variety of timetable tools and scheduling apps. One of the most commonly used tools 
by us is the course timetable on Acorn. However, during our daily use of this tool, 
we find that there are several things about this tool that we are not satisfied enough 
due to the inconvenience or lack of efficiency. For example, when a student is lined up
in the waitlist of a course, it is still possible for him or her to enrol in courses
that even take place at the same time as the course in his or her waitlist, but when he
or she is removed from the waitlist to the enrolment list of that course automatically,
there will be a time conflict in his or her timetable on Acorn. Acorn will just leave
this conflict as it is without throwing any warnings to the student to inform this
conflict. As a result, our group decides to create a new timetable planning tool by using
our knowledge base on Java. This tool will enable users to check the information of UofT
courses according to a course database as well as schedule the courses they currently
enrol in. They can also make full use of this tool by customizing and putting personal
events in the timetable to plan their daily study and life.

## Summary Of Current Progress

## Future TODOs

* GUI
* Implement Operateor Interface
* Implement Functions class
* Implement codes to catch invalid input exceptions
* Implement codes to store data by user account (if possible)
* Modify Life class for refurring sessions
* Modify Descriptionlesslife class for further needs
* Add JavaDoc

## Difficulties That We Currently Face With (Suggestions Eagerly Needed)

* Lack of JavaDoc makes it difficult for quick communication.
* Frequent changing of the code structure costs great amount of time and effort.
* There is always a conflict between keeping adding features to make the program better and the will of reducing workload even if it is just phase 0.

## Contribution Of Each Group Member

### Aiden Lin (linhaoz3 - aiden.lin@mail.utoronto.ca)

* Writing part of the progress report for phase 0
* Handling the implementation of coding for catching and reporting exceptions and conflicts in TimeTableManager class
